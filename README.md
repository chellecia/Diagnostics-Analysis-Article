# 🩺 Diagnostic Analysis of IQI and Tuberculosis in Jakarta

This project conducts a comprehensive diagnostic analysis using **BPJS Kesehatan** data to explore **Indonesia’s Quality Indicators (IQI)** and **Tuberculosis (TBC)** cases in Jakarta. The goal is to uncover public health trends, identify co-morbidities, and provide evidence-based insights for policy-making.

📄 The findings are also compiled into an accompanying article to promote public awareness and support data-driven health interventions.

## 🔎 Hidden Insights: TB Beyond the Surface

### 💉 TB & Diabetes: A Dangerous Pair
- Diabetics are **3x more likely** to develop active TB due to weakened immunity.
- TB complicates diabetes treatment by disrupting glucose regulation and interfering with medication.

### 🌫️ The Air We Breathe: Pollution’s Role
- Particulate matter (PM2.5, NO₂) causes chronic inflammation in the lungs, increasing TB vulnerability.
- Residents of highly polluted districts showed higher TB prevalence.

### 🚺 TB Affects More Women & the Elderly
- Most cases are in **women of reproductive age** and **seniors (60+)**.
- Elderly face greater complications due to weakened immunity and comorbidities.
- Many female patients also access **maternal health and contraception services**, reflecting health access burdens.


## 👩‍⚕️ Conclusion

> “Kesehatan adalah tentang akses dan perlindungan untuk semua, tanpa memandang usia atau jenis kelamin.”  

This analysis shows how combining diagnostic health data with environmental factors and demographics can reveal critical insights for improving public health outcomes in urban populations.
